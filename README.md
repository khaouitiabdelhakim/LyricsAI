## How to Use
To use the LyricsAI library in your Android project, follow these steps:

**Step 1. Add the JitPack Repository and Dependencies**

First, add the JitPack repository to your root build.gradle file to enable the use of the LyricsAI library. Add it at the end of the repositories section:

```groovy
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

Next, add the LyricsAI library as a dependency in your app's build.gradle file. Be sure to replace `Tag` with the specific release version you want to use:
latest version is [![](https://jitpack.io/v/khaouitiabdelhakim/LyricsAI.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#khaouitiabdelhakim/LyricsAI)

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.khaouitiabdelhakim:LyricsAI:Tag'
}
```

Please note that this library uses web scraping to retrieve lyrics, which can be resource-intensive. Therefore, it's essential to perform these operations in the background using Coroutines.

**Step 2. Adding Coroutines Dependency**

To handle asynchronous operations efficiently, you should add Coroutines dependencies to your project. Add the following dependencies with the latest version:

```groovy
// For Coroutines
implementation 'org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:1.6.4'
implementation 'org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-android:1.6.4'
```

**Step 3. Creating a Coroutine Scope**

To use the LyricsAI library in a Coroutine scope, you can create a CoroutineScope with a specific dispatcher:

```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.CoroutineScope
import kotlinx.coroutines.Dispatchers
import kotlinx.coroutines.Job
import kotlinx.coroutines.launch

// Create a CoroutineScope
val scope = CoroutineScope(Job() + Dispatchers.Main)
```

**Step 4. Retrieving Lyrics**

You can now use the CoroutineScope to retrieve lyrics in the background. Here's how to do it:

```kotlin
scope.launch {
    // To retrieve lyrics by song title
    val title = "YourSongTitle"
    val lyrics = LyricsAI.findLyricsBySongTitle(title)

    // To retrieve lyrics by both song title and artist
    val title = "YourSongTitle"
    val artist = "ArtistName"
    val lyrics = LyricsAI.findLyricsBySongTitleAndArtist(title, artist)
}
```

This approach ensures that the library's operations are performed asynchronously and won't block the main thread, offering a smoother user experience in your Android application.


Please ensure you handle network and web scraping exceptions in your application as needed.

## Features

- Retrieve song lyrics with a simple song title query or a combination of title and artist.
